    "### **PART 1 -THEORETICAL QUESTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **K-Nearest Neighbor Classification**\n",
    "##### **1.**\n",
    " Assume that you have a large training dataset. Specify a disadvantage of the k- Nearest Neighbor method when using it during testing. State also your reason about your answer.\n",
    "##### **Answer:**  \n",
    "KNN is a supervied, non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm. Non-parametric means that it does not make any assumptions about the data so it avoids the wrong modeling distrubition of the data. Instance-based means that it actually does not learn but it memorizes the training examples. KNN works by finding the distances between test and train examples in the data and votes for the most smallest k distances. For each test example we have to find the distance between for each train example. If the train dataset size is to large then we need to make too many comparisons. This increases the time drastically.\n",
    "##### **2.**\n",
    "Create a 1-Dimensional classifcation dataset in which the 1-Nearest Neighbors method always gives a leave-one out cross validation error value of 1 (In other words, the method can't guess correct class for a specifc point in the dataset ). State also a proper explanation about your reasoning.\n",
    "##### **Answer:** \n",
    "For a 1-D space, we can think of a line. For the class labels lets say we have 2 classes which are positive and negative. So the points in the line can either be positive or negative. Lets say we have a sequential group of points and the corresponding class labels go like this: Positive, Negative, Positive,Negative,...,Positive. So if we take one point from this line and apply 1-NN algorithm, it will always return the wrong class label due to the positions of each point.\n",
    "##### **3.**\n",
    "Assume that you have the following training set of positive (+), negative (-) instances and a single test instance (o) in the figure below (Figure 1). Assume also that the Euclidean metric is used for measuring the distance between instances. Finally consider that every nearest neighbor instance affects the final vote equally.\n",
    "- What is the class appointed to the test instance for K=1? State also reason behind your answer.\n",
    "##### **Answer:**\n",
    " If the k=1, it means that KNN will vote for the smallest distance example. So If we look at to the table, we can easily see that the closest point to our test point has the label \"-\". For that reason the predicted class label is \"-\" for our test point.\n",
    "- What is the class appointed to the test instance for K=3? State also reason behind your answer.\n",
    "##### **Answer:**\n",
    " If the k=3, it means that KNN will vote for the smallest 3 distance examples. So If we look at to the table, we can see that the closest 2 points to our test point has the label \"-\" and the other closest point has the label \"+\". From the majority voting, our test point' class will be predicted as \"-\".\n",
    "- What is the class appointed to the test instance for K=5? State also reason behind your answer.\n",
    "##### **Answer:**\n",
    " If the k=5, it means that KNN will vote for the smallest 5 distance examples. So If we look at to the table, we can see that the closest 2 points to our test point has the label \"-\" and the other 3 closest point have the label \"+\". From the majority voting, our test point' class will be predicted as \"+\".\n",
    "##### **4.** \n",
    "Fill the blanks with True or False for the statements below.\n",
    "- (TRUE) If all instances of the data have the same scale then k-Nearest Neighbor's performance increases drastically.\n",
    "- (TRUE) While k-Nearest Neighbor performs well with a small number of input variables, it's performance decreases when the number of inputs becomes large.\n",
    "- (TRUE) K-Nearest Neighbor makes no assumption about the functional form of the problem it handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Linear Regression**\n",
    "#####  Assume that you have five students have registered to a class and the class have a midterm and the final exam. You have obtained a set of their marks on two exams, which is in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student | Midterm Exam | Midterm Exam (Squared) | Final Exam |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| $x^{(1)}$ | 87 | 7569 | 94 |\n",
    "| $x^{(2)}$ | 70 | 4900 | 72 |\n",
    "| $x^{(3)}$ | 92 | 8464 | 85 |\n",
    "| $x^{(4)}$ | 67 | 4489 | 76 |\n",
    "| $x^{(5)}$ | 45 | 2025 | 51 |\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### **1-** You plan to a model which form's is $f_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2$ for fitting the data above. The $x_1$ shows midterm exam score while $x_2$ shows square of the midterm score. Besides you plan to use feature scaling (using divide operation by the \"max-min\", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization. What is the normalized value of the feature $x_2^{(4)}$?\n",
    "- ##### **Answer:** Normalization can be thought as min-max or mean normalization. I have calculated the min-max normalization.The formula is written below:\n",
    "<center> $x^\\prime = \\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}$ </center>\n",
    "So te normalized value for $x_2^{(4)}$ is:\n",
    "<center> $x_2^{(4)}\\prime = \\frac{4900 - 2025}{8464 - 2025} = 0.38266$  </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### **2-** Considering the figure below (Figure 2), which of the offsets used in linear regressions least square line fit? Assume that horizontal axis represents independent variable and vertical axis represents dependent variable. State your answer with your proper explanation.\n",
    "- ##### **Answer:** Vertical offsets are used in linear regression because the calculation of the vertical distaces are easier than the calculation of the perpentidicular distances. <br>\n",
    "\"*In practice, the vertical offsets from a line are almost always minimized instead of the perpendicular offsets. This allows uncertainties of the data points along the $x$- and $y$-axes to be incorporated simply, and also provides a much simpler analytic form for the fitting parameters than would be obtained using a fit based on perpendicular distances. In addition, the fitting technique can be easily generalized from a best-fit line to a best-fit polynomial when sums of vertical distances are used (which is not the case using perpendicular distances). For a reasonable number of noisy data points, the difference between vertical and perpendicular fits is quite small.*\"[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### **3-** Considering the table below (Table 1), consisting of four training examples: <center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| x | y |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1 | 0.5 |\n",

    "| 4 | 2 |\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | \n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that you are trying to fit the data above to the linear regression model $f_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1$. Find the $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ values by using closed form solution $(\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty)$. Also state dimension values of $X$, $y$ and $\\theta$ matrices. Finally show your calculations step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### **Answer:**\n",
    "$\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$,  where $\\theta$ = $w$ and $w$ = \n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}w1 \\\\w2 \\\\w3\\\\...\\\\ wm\\end{bmatrix}$ and\n",
    "\n",
    " $X$ = $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & x1^(1) & x1^(2) & ... & x1^(m)\n",
    "                      \\\\1 & x2^(1) & x2^(2) & ... & x2^(m)\n",

    "$X$ and $y$ matrices. $X = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the given $y$ is $y = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end\n",
    "{bmatrix}$. We want to find the weight matrix which is $w$. Here are the step by step calculations:<br> Transpose of $X$ is, $X^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ . <br>Inverse of $(X^TX)^{-1}$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "- ##### **4-** State a valid reason for feature scaling and explain why it is a valid reason with respect to your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### **Answer:** Feature scaling is a technique in Machine Learning to standardize the independent feaures in some range. Not every dataset requires feature scaling. This is needed when each feaure is in different ranges. If one of the feature has a range of 0-50.000 and the other feature has a range of 0-2, then for linear regression the dominant feature will be the first one. To prevent this Feature Scaling technique is used to put all features in a same range.\n",

    "### **PART 2 - MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**\n",
    "#### **2.1 IMPLEMENTATION**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p>  In this assignment we are required to implement a movie recommendation system. We are given four datasets which are the \"ratings_train.csv\", \"movies.csv\", \"tags.csv\", \"links.csv\". Here ratings_train.csv contains ratings given by each user to each movie they had seen before. This is the most important information to be able to implement this assignment since we are required to implement user-based collaborative filtering. Also we are required to implement our K-fold Cross Validation algorithm, similarity functions and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. I explained the steps I have follow below in details. </p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    " First of all, I read the \"ratings_train.csv\" dataset and created a dataframe as *users_to_movies_df*. Each user and movie has a corresponding id and the ratings value in range between 0-5. \"*users_to_movies_df*\" dataframe holds the ratings given by each user as values, rows represent the id of each user and columns represent the id of each movie.\n",
    " Later, I implemented my K-fold cross validation algorithm as a function called ***k-fold(df,k)*** . This function takes 2 arguments; first one is a dataframe to be splitted as *df* and the second one is the number of folds the data should be splitted as *k*.\n",
    " General K-fold algorithms used to create a test and train datasets by dividing a one huge dataset into *k* folds. These folds are used in *cross validation*. For each fold, we take one fold as test dataset and the others as train dataset. There is the simple explanation of cross validation: <br>\n",
    " \"*Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.*\" [1] <br>\n",
    " The value of *k* should be chosen carefully because it effects the sampling of whole dataset. Here, I have tried many values for *k* and reported. Usually values 5 and 10 are chosen for *k* but it is not a rule to be followed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In my k-fold implementation, the function ***k-fold(df,k)*** returns the *k* indices with start and end points that should be used to split the dataset. These indices are used in another function called ***create_train_test(df, ind_arr, mode)***. This function takes the dataframe to be splitted as *df*, the number of folds as *k* and with which value the *NaN* values in *df* will be swapped as *mode*. Here the *df* is actually the dataframe that each row consists of one unique *userId*, each column is unique *movieId* and the values are the ratings. It is called *users_to_movies_df*. **I did not shuffle this dataframe because it would not effect the result since each user is represented in one single row.** ***I did not apply k-fold algorithm directly into *ratings_train.csv* dataset because if a user is in test fold then it should not be in the train fold. To manage this, I directly applied the k-fold algorithm into *users_to_movies_df* dataframe.***\n",
    "This function also calls the *create_movies_ratings(df_with_NaNs, mode)* function to handle the *NaN* values in *df*. If the *mode* is 1 then *NaN* values are replaced with 0, if *mode* is 2 then *NaN* values are replaced with the mean with respect to x-axis and if *mode* is 3 then *NaN* values are replaced with the mean with respect to y-axis. I used *mode* as 1 in the report because it was the simplest and fastest method but other modes are also available.\n",
    " </br><br>\n",
    "Now, since I created the test/train datasets, I implemented the other parts.\n",
    "Next, I implemented the similarity calculation part. Here I created a function called ***cosine_similarity(df1, df2)*** to be able to calculate the *cosine* similarity between given two dataframes. First dataframe is the test dataset and the second dataframe is the train dataset. This function basically calculates the cosine similarity between two matrix. Returns a matrix and a dataframe which consists of the calculated similarity values between for each test and train data. It does matrix multiplication rather than comparing each test case with each train case. \n",
    "Cosine similariy function is written below:\n",
    "</br><br>\n",
    "<center>$cos(x) = \\frac{ a^→ . b^→}{||a||.||b||}$ </center>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I chosed to implement cosine similarity. Here is the short explanation:\n",
    " <br>*Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size.*[2] </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I implemented K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with a function called ***knn(df, k, kernel)***. The first argument is the similarity dataframe as *df*, the second is the number of *k* neigherest neighbors that will be considered and the third is the weight function as *kernel*. This function calls another function to be able to calculate the weights. It is \"*calculate_weights(k,df, kernel)*\" and the parameters are the same .Here, if the parameter *kernel* is passed as \"**uniform**\" then the weightes are 1 for each of the *k* neighbor. If the *kernel* is passed as \"**self-defined**\" then the weights are calculated as the powers of 0.5 ( where the power are from 0 to k-1). If the *kernel* is passed as \"**harmonic series**\" then the weights are calculated as \"*1/(i+1)*\" ( i is in range 0 to k-1 ). If the *kernel* is passed as \"**inverse-distance**\", then the weights are calculated as the inverses of their distance. So, with respect to these weights the most similar(closer) users to our test users are found.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to calculate the **Mean Average Error** for each test fold. This step is actually comparing our predictions (test folds) with the ground-truth informations (train folds). If there is *k* number of folds created then *calculate_mae(list1, list2)* calculates *k* number of error values between test and train folds. For the error of the whole program, I have taken the mean of these *k* errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementing this assignment, I tried different *k* values for K-fold, different *k* values for K-Nearest Neighbor and  different similarity metrics. Here are my experimental results in a plot with different combinations of these hyperparameters.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I have used ***uniform weights*** for the KNN algorithm. In the Table 1, you can see the experimental results with different number of folds to different number of nearest neighbors and the corresponding MAE errors. These errors have the highest values between the other kernel function weights.\n",
    "- Table 1 \n",
    " ![UNIFORM KERNEL WEIGHTS](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1doS29mYBO7jXrxo6wNlX-S6m_LkDuK2t)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I have used ***self-defined weights*** for the KNN algorithm which is defines as the powers of 0.5 where the power value starts from 0. In the Table 2, you can see the experimental results with different number of folds to different number of nearest neighbors and the corresponding MAE errors. This actually gave the lowest error values between the others. I think the reason is, the kernel funtion goes down faster compare to the other kernel functions. So that after the second closest neighbor, the rest is not that much important.\n",
    "- Table 2\n",
    "![SELF-DEFINED KERNEL WEIGHTS](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E8kbh23cpR0lo_xLFImdzWyAIAs9yqoO)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I have used ***harmonic series weights*** for the KNN algorithm which I have talked about the function previously. You can see the experimental results with different number of folds to different number of nearest neighbors and the corresponding MAE errors in Table 3.\n",
    "- Table 3 \n",
    "![HARMONIC SERIES KERNEL WEIGHTS](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ml0dNE9GsmCCy10O-QfmIjyHuNJhRgVy)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, I have used ***inverse distance weights*** for the KNN algorithm. In the Table 4, you can see the experimental results with different number of folds to different number of nearest neighborsand the corresponding MAE errors. As you can see, the results in Table 3 and Table 4 are really close to each other. The reason behind this is the kernel functions look alike.\n",
    "- Table 4\n",
    "![INVERSE DISTANCE KERNEL WEIGHTS](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MgJ_tiKSW43msiHtY96KWX0KjvOCzRff)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The error values with the 1-NN in all of the tables are the same. Because I defined the kernels(weights) to be 1 for the nearest neighbor.\n",
    "From the tables above we can see that the *k=5* for KNN, MAE values are drastically down. From that point, the error values rise a bit but then go really down after that. From my point of view, after *k=5* it starts to overfit. What I mean by \"overfit\" is, our KNN algorithm starts to consider noises as well. So that for the specific dataset, our model with these parameters seems to be the perfect one. But the perfect one is the one which generalizes well. For this reason, I chose the **perfect** one as with the kernel function *harmonic series*, *k=10* in K-fold and *k=5* in KNN.\n",
